            <h2>Benefits of joining IPSSA San Diego</h2>
            <p>The Independent Pool and Spa Service Association was formed in 1988 as a result of a merger between IPSA and Cal-IPSA. These two organizations were a part of the original association founded in 1961 for the purpose of pool service technicians coming together in order to help each other in times of illness, injury, or disability.</p>
            <p>IPSSA begins with the individual member who belongs to a chapter. All chapters are clustered   geographically   into regions. Each region elects a representative to the Board of Regional Directors (BORD).</p>
            <p>A paid executive secretary handles the administrative and an independent contractor handles the financial matters, both under the direction of the board.</p>
